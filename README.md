# West Nile Virus (WNV) Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach to Public Health Surveillance

## Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing mosquito tracking data from Chicago, Illinois, to better understand the spread of West Nile Virus (WNV). The project is divided into two deliverables that cover data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and advanced statistical modeling. The objective is to analyze trends in mosquito populations and WNV prevalence to support public health efforts.

## Problem Statement
West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne disease that poses a significant health risk to urban populations. By analyzing mosquito tracking data collected between 2008 and 2019, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform disease surveillance and prevention strategies.

## Impact
The findings of this project can have the following impacts:
- **Improved Public Health Surveillance**: Providing actionable insights into mosquito populations and WNV prevalence to help authorities focus prevention efforts.
- **Disease Prevention**: Identifying patterns in mosquito species and WNV spread to mitigate risks.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Enhancing urban planning and public health strategies based on data insights.
